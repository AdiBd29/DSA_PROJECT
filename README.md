# DSA_PROJECT
# Shortest Path Finder

This repository contains a C++ program designed to compute the shortest path in a given graph using a specific algorithm. This is typically useful in various applications like routing, navigation, and network optimization.

## Features

- **Graph Input**: Accepts weighted graphs as input, where weights represent the cost or distance between nodes.
- **Shortest Path Calculation**: Utilizes an efficient algorithm to find the shortest paths from a source node to all other nodes in the graph.
- **Result Display**: Outputs the shortest path lengths and the paths themselves.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
- Make (optional for building)

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/shortest-path-finder.git
cd shortest-path-finder
g++ -o ShortestPath SHORTEST_PATH.cpp
make
./ShortestPath
